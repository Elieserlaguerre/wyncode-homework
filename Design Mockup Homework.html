    <p>Hello once again, my name is Elieser Laguerre!<br>
      I was born and raised in Miami, Florida!<br>
      I'm currently learning to become a software developer.<br>
      I love the thought of being able to create software tools
      that can do all type of things in the near future!  </p>
      <p>I'm hoping that with these new skills at my disposal I will be able to open up
        new opportunities for employment in the labor market! <b>
        </b>but my main reason for wanting to find employment as a developer is to gain experience in the field! </p>
        <p>If you'd like to learn more about me, by all means please contact me by filling out the form bellow!</p>
